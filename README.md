# dockerize-mongodb-replicaset
Dockerize MongoDB Replica Set" is a project that aims to provide a containerized and easily deployable setup for running MongoDB in a replica set configuration. The project utilizes Docker containers to create multiple MongoDB instances, each running in its own container, and sets up the necessary configuration to form a replica set.

The main advantages of using a MongoDB replica set are data redundancy, high availability, and automatic failover. By deploying MongoDB in a replica set, you ensure that your data is replicated across multiple nodes, which improves reliability and protects against data loss. In case one of the nodes goes down, the remaining nodes can continue serving data, providing high availability for your application. Additionally, replica sets enable automatic failover, where a new primary node is elected if the current primary becomes unavailable.


The "dockerize-mongodb-replicaset" project typically consists of the following components:

1) Docker: Docker is used to create isolated containers for running MongoDB instances. Each MongoDB instance represents a node in the replica set.

2) MongoDB: The MongoDB database server is used to store and manage the data. Each MongoDB instance runs in a separate container.

3) Replica Set Configuration: The project includes scripts or configuration files to set up the replica set. This involves specifying the replica set name, assigning roles to nodes (primary, secondary, and arbiters), and defining the communication between the nodes.

4) Networking: Docker networking is used to establish communication between the MongoDB containers. This allows the nodes to synchronize data and perform replication.


By following the instructions provided in the "dockerize-mongodb-replicaset" project, you can easily create a replica set configuration for MongoDB using Docker containers. This setup allows you to quickly deploy and manage a highly available and fault-tolerant MongoDB cluster.

Please note that the specific implementation details and steps may vary depending on the project or tutorial you are following. It's recommended to refer to the documentation or instructions provided with the "dockerize-mongodb-replicaset" project for the most accurate and up-to-date information on how to set up the MongoDB replica set using Docker.


Follow Below Steps To Configure MongoDB replicaset.

1) First create a docker network for this environment.
```
sudo docker network create mongo-docker-network
```

2) For setup we have to create mongodb.keyfile first.Below i metioned command that will create file.                                                                   
```
    cd data/mongo
    openssl rand -base64 768 > mongo.keyfile
    sudo chown 999:999 mongo.keyfile
    sudo chmod 400 mongo.keyfile
```
